# IMT2681 Assignment 2

This is my submission for assignment 2 in the course IMT2681 Cloud Technologies. The task was to build a RESTful API which allows users to browse information about IGC files, using the open-source library [goigc](https://github.com/marni/goigc).

Users can add URLs to IGC resources to a database on the server and query information about added tracks. There is also webhook functionality which allows to subscribe to recieve information about newly registered tracks.

The API is deployed on Heroku here:
